# How to use
### First: This currently only changes vampire sheets to your picked player color. Not any other sheet types, you need to modify that yourself.
1. You need to install the Artificer UI module which is still in beta for the left-side bar and the glass-style AND the Custom CSS module to use the CSS code.
2. Additionally you need an active internet connection for the Vollkorn font to work (it's imported using the CSS) - you can install it on the system manually instead if you need to.
3. Paste the code from the css.txt file into your Custom CSS window.
