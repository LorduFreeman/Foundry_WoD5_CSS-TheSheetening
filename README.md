### V3 styling with Vampire colors changed to blue hues

# How to use
### First: This currently only changes vampire sheets to your picked player color. Not any other sheet types, you need to modify that yourself.
1. You need to install the Artificer UI module which is still in beta for the left-side bar and the glass-style AND the Custom CSS module to use the CSS code.
2. Additionally you need an active internet connection for the Vollkorn font to work (it's imported using the CSS) - you can install it on the system manually instead if you need to.
3. Paste the code from one of the "css" text files into your Custom CSS window.

### V3 Styling
1. V3 allows you to selectively use the colors for the splat you want, just replace the "vampire" in lines 5-7 with "werewolf" or "hunter"
2. Similarly you can add custom colors instead as well.
